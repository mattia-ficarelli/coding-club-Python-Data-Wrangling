# coding-club-Python-Data-Wrangling

Session focused on data wrangling using publically available data. It uses the Pandas library (and a soup√ßon of NumPy) to download excel files from a URL, modify variables, merge and append dataframes together, collapse/summarise the dataframe, and finally reshape it into wide format for outputting in a more human-readable view.
